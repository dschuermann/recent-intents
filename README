Reads out recent Intents _with_ their extras bundle.
Apps could leak sensitive private information in their Intent extras.



Citing baske from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15501260/protecting-extra-data-in-android-intent 

Starting from Android 4.1.1 an additional permission was added to guard extra's being read by third party apps using the RecentTaskInfo. This permission (android.Manifest.permission.GET_DETAILED_TASKS) can only be acquired by the system. Without this permission, the extra's will be swapped out before the baseIntent is returned via the RecentTaskInfo.

From the comment of commit http://androidxref.com/4.2.2_r1/history/frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/am/ActivityManagerService.java#8238e717df4bc5eebf15f97172d68af3599a95bb:

    Add new signature-level permission to get details of tasks.

    Third party apps now can't get access to the extras of the intents associated with tasks, to keep private data in them from leaking out.

So it seems that effort is being put into making intent extra's safer to transport sensitive information. I don't know if there are other ways in which these extra can leak, but at least the extra's seem OK from JB up.
